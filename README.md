# A* Pathfinding Project
This repository contains the A* algorithm implementation taught at Udacity [C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) during C++ Foundations lessons. This pathfinding algorithm can find a path through obstacles between two known points in the ASCII board.

### Dependencies for Running Locally
- **Operating System** >= Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.6
- **c++** >= 9.3.0 (C++ compiler for command line. Xcode needs to be installed)
- **gdb** >= 9.1 (C++ debugger)

### Compiling and Running
>A pre-compiled version can be found on the project folder (`search`).
#### Compiling
1. Open Terminal (Launchpad->Other->Terminal)
2. Navigate to the project folder. In my case:
```
$ cd ~/Documents/GitHub/A\*_Pathfinding/
```
3. Compile the `.cpp` file and generate an `search` output file
```
c++ A_search.cpp -o search
```

This should take a few seconds and the output file `search` should auto-generate on the project folder.

#### Running
1. Run the output file `search`.
```
$ ./search
```
